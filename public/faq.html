      <h2>1.	Do I need to be tech savvy to use a robot mower?</h2>
      <p>a.	No, Ambrogio robot mowers have an intuitive, easy to follow LED panel and several “how-to” videos that guide owners through setup, programming and operation of the robot.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="thefaq">
      <h2>2.	When and how often does a robot mower cut the grass? </h2>
      <p>a.	You set the days and times the robot is allowed to operate, any time, day or night.</p>
      <p>b.	Once installed and programmed, the robot will automatically mow based on your settings, with little to no need for any human interaction.</p>
      <p>c.	If it’s raining during a defined mowing time, the robot will return to the charging station and wait until the next scheduled time to mow.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="thefaq">
      <h2>3.	 How do Robot lawn mowers work?</h2>
      <p>a.	Most robot mowers navigate around your yard within an area defined by a guide-wire similar to an invisible dog fence.  By following the wire and based on feedback from built-in obstacle and distance sensors, the robot is able to navigate around obstacles.</p>
      <p>b.	With Ambrogio ZCS connect, you can access the robot’s settings remotely using an IOS or Android device.  This allows you to change programming, command the robot to return to its charging station, and check for any errors.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="thefaq">
      <h2>4.	How long does it take a robot mower to cut a lawn?</h2>
      <p>a.	This varies depending on the model of robot, and the size of the lawn.
        <br>
        <br>
        It’s important to note that with a robotic mower, it does not particularly matter how long it takes.  The robot does not require human supervision or intervention to do its job, so it can be scheduled to work at any time, day or night, and on any combination of days of the week.  The idea is to program the robot to mow at times you would typically not be home, or at times you would not normally be outside in your yard.</p>
      <p>b.	The limiting factor of how long it takes to cut is the size of the battery. Generally, more expensive models have higher capacity batteries and are rated for larger lawns. </p>
      <p>c.	To maximize the amount of lawn that can be cut in the least amount of time, the Ambrogio L250 and larger robots offer a “smart partition” cutting system which allows the robot to divide the total area to be mowed into smaller sections.
        <br>
        <br>
      When fully charged and properly programmed, the robot recognizes sections that have recently been mowed, allowing it to move on to an adjacent un-mowed section.
        <br>
        <br>
      If the robot had to skip a section due to an obstacle, rain, user command, or some other condition or error, it will remember to return to that section to finish, then continue on.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="thefaq">
      <h2>5.	Does a robot mower leave tracks?</h2>
      <p>a.	A default function of a robot mower is to follow the guide wire back to the base.  Over time, this can cause ruts to form along the guide wire. Ambrogio robots have a return to base mode that tells the robot to do a zig-zag pattern along the guide wire.  This helps prevent ruts from forming.</p>
      <p>b.	If the robot mows on wet or high grass, ruts can form depending upon ground condition and grass height.  If ruts develop beyond the return path of the guide wire, that could indicate the mower is not programmed to run often or long enough to fully mow the lawn.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="thefaq">
      <h2>6.	Will a robot mower cut in straight lines to give me that visual effect?</h2>
      <p>a.	Because robot mowers operate in a random mode, there is no way to program the mower to cut in a way that gives you that visual effect.  This is one of the trade-off’s of using a robot mower.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="thefaq">
      <h2>7.	Why do robot mowers cut in random patterns?  What are the benefits?</h2>
      <p>a.	Mowing in a random pattern ensures cutting occurs from different directions. This produces a beautiful-looking lawn and a homogenous surface that always looks as if it was just cut.
        <br>
        <br>
        Additionally, a random mowing pattern leaves no uncut grass, making it the most reliable way to cover an entire lawn.  The result is an even, carpet like look to the lawn.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="thefaq">
      <h2>8.	Will the robot completely eliminate me having to care for my lawn?</h2>
      <p>a.	A robot mower drastically reduces the time you spend mowing your lawn, but it can’t do edging, and there are some areas the lawn the robot simply can’t reach. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="thefaq">
      <h2>9.	Can the robot mower detect objects?</h2>
      <p>a.	Ambrogio robots are equipped with bump sensors that detect semi-stationary objects over 4” tall.  When the robot bumps into an object the mower stops and changes direction.</p>
      <p>b.	Ambrogio robots have sharp, solid steel blades and strong motors that use the entire area of the blade to cut.  They can easily mow over some normal lawn debris.  But you should still periodically inspect the area where your robotic will operate, and be sure to remove any stones, toys, branches, or any other visible objects.  </p>
      <p>c.	If the robot does get stuck on or damaged by an object, it will turn itself off and show an error code in the LED display.  Errors that occur on models with Ambrogio ZCS connect, can be accessed remotely.  Resolution can be as simple as lifting the robot off of the obstacle, clearing the error, and returning it to the charging base.  In cases of extreme contact with the blade, the robot should be inspected to ensure it has not sustained any damage.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="thefaq">
      <h2>10.	What are some of the most common errors with robot mowers?</h2>
      <p><b>a.	Common problems include:</b></p>
        <div class="doubleindent">
        <p>
          <br>
          <br>
          i.	Improperly laid guide wire that allows the robot to get too close to a ledge, curbs, trees, lawn ornaments and other objects.   This can cause the robot to roll off of a curb, get caught on a root, or bump into immoveable objects that result in the mower changing direction leaving uncut areas.  Proper placement of the guide wire is very important.
          <br>
          <br>
          ii.	Cutting an area with a slope greater than what the robot is designed for.  This can cause the mower to roll over.  With proper ground wire placement, Ambrogio robots can operate at slopes up to a max of 35°
          <br>
          <br>
          iii.	Under-sized robots, and Inefficient programming.  If the robot is not large enough for the area, or is not given enough time to mow the entire lawn, it may never be able to fully cover the entire mowing area.
          <br>
          <br>
          It’s important to properly size your mower based on the total area of your lawn, and to program it so it can operate often and long enough to cover the total area.  The good news is, Ambrogio robots come in many sizes and models for very small or very large lawns, and you can program the robot to operate any day of the week, any time of day.  This makes it possible for a properly sized mower to cover your entire lawn.
